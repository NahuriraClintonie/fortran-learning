# fortran-learning

A personal repository for learning Modern Fortran through structured examples, scientific programming exercises, and well-commented exploration programs.

This repository is meant to serve as:

- A structured learning space
- A progression tracker as I learn Modern Fortran
- A place to keep small programs, experiments, and notes
- A foundation for future scientific and high-performance computing projects

## 📂 Repository Structure

```
